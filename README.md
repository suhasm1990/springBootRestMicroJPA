RESTful Spring Boot Microservice with JPA

This is a Spring Boot Hypermedia-Driven RESTful Microservice. Microservices are small, light, modular software programs, designed to fulfill one or a few purposes. They may be deployed independently, in small groups, in a container, or as part of a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) framework. They stand in contrast to more traditional monolithic programs, which are designed to fulfill several needs.

Microservices are quicker to build and deploy. Larger applications are slower because they have many different modules, all of which must be integrated and deployed as part of the program. Microservices architecture allows admins or users to load just the services that are required, which improves deploy times, especially when packaged in containers.

This RESTful Spring Boot Microservice is hosted the microservice on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and below are the links for reference:
